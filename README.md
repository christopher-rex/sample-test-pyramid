# Sample Test Pyramid

This repository is to demonstrate a TestPyramid implementation, with different automated test layers in action. For the purpose of this demonstration, we have built a web application (backed by a http service) which is the application under testing. 

## What is TestPyramid?

[Learn from Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html)

## Application under test

The application we have is a simple coupon-validation app, which takes in a coupon-code for input and validates the coupon.

The application itself has two functional components,
1. Web application layer or simply the UI layer
2. Service Layer
